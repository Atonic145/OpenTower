# Pizza Tower
- A full decompilation of Pizza Tower V1.0.311.
- The Steamworks extension has been removed, with its code commented out.

# Requirements
- [Pizza Tower](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/)
- [GameMaker `2022.9.1.66`](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2022.9.1.51.exe) (There's a branch that fixes some code to let the game run in the latest version, but it does have a bunch of issues...)

# Importing Assets
This repository doesn't include any of the FMOD banks or sprites. An [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/releases) script is included to extract everything needed from the `data.win` and port the required files to the decomp.
